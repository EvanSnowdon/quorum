Quorum turns the playbooks of the world's best-known strategy thinkers into agent skills, then staffs them as a multi-agent consulting firm. Ask for any region and industry; get back a sourced, fact-checked, consulting-grade market report.

It ships in two layers:

- **Layer 1 — The Skills Library.** Fifteen self-contained methodology analysts (Porter's Five Forces, Jobs-to-be-Done, 7 Powers, Playing to Win, and more) packaged as plain-text `SKILL.md` files. Install them into Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or any skills-compatible agent and use each one standalone.
- **Layer 2 — The Firm.** A multi-agent engagement engine. You specify `region × industry × depth`; an engagement manager decomposes the brief, dispatches a parallel team of methodology experts grounded in official statistics, and routes every draft through fact-checking, red-team, and editorial gates before the final report lands on disk.

## Why Quorum

A single analyst-grade market report from a commercial research house typically costs **$800–$2,850** and takes days to procure. A Quorum engagement covering the same ground runs on roughly **$4 of model tokens** and finishes in minutes — with every claim labeled, sourced, and auditable.

| | Commercial report | Quorum |
|---|---|---|
| Price | $800–$2,850 per report | ~$4 in tokens (standard depth) |
| Turnaround | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| Coverage | Catalog-limited | Any region × any industry |
| Methodology | Opaque | Open, inspectable SKILL.md files |
| Sourcing | Trust the brand | Official-statistics-first, every claim tagged `[DATA]` or `[INFERENCE]` with confidence levels |
| Customization | None | Fork it. It's MIT. |

Quorum is not a replacement for proprietary expert networks or human judgment (see [Honest limitations](#honest-limitations)). It is a replacement for the long tail of overpriced, under-sourced market overviews.

## Quickstart

### Mode 1 — Skills only

Install the analyst skills into any skills-compatible agent:

```bash
npx skills add EvanSnowdon/quorum
```

Or, inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add EvanSnowdon/quorum
```

Then invoke any analyst directly — for example, ask your agent to "run a five-forces analysis on the European battery recycling market" and the `five-forces-analyst` skill drives the structure, evidence standards, and output format.

### Mode 2 — The full firm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvanSnowdon/quorum.git
cd quorum
pip install -e .

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...   # or OPENAI_API_KEY, or point at a local model

quorum --region CN --industry "electric vehicles" --depth standard
```

The engagement runs end to end and writes a full report bundle to `engagements/<timestamp>-cn-electric-vehicles/`, including the final report, per-expert working papers, the source ledger, and quality-gate findings.

Want to see the output first? [`examples/cn-electric-vehicles.md`](examples/cn-electric-vehicles.md) is a complete ~27,000-word report from a real single-command run at `standard` depth (deepseek-chat, under a dollar of API spend). Read the Executive Summary's decision-gated conclusion, then the Reconciliation section — the editor must answer every red-team argument, and the verbatim dissent ships in the report.

### Bring your own model

Quorum is model-agnostic. Pick any provider and model per run:

```bash
# Anthropic (default)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
quorum --region CN --industry "electric vehicles"

# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
quorum --region CN --industry "electric vehicles" --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, vLLM — any OpenAI-compatible API
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-provider-key>
quorum --region CN --industry "electric vehicles" \
  --provider openai --base-url https://api.deepseek.com --model deepseek-chat

# Fully local via Ollama — free, nothing leaves your machine
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama   # any non-empty value; local servers ignore it
quorum --region CN --industry "electric vehicles" \
  --provider openai --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model qwen3
```

Use `--lead-model` / `--worker-model` to split roles — a strong model for orchestration, red-teaming, and editing; a cheap fast one for the parallel analysts. The same settings are available as environment variables (`QUORUM_PROVIDER`, `QUORUM_MODEL`, `QUORUM_LEAD_MODEL`, `QUORUM_WORKER_MODEL`, `QUORUM_BASE_URL`) or in `.env`; flags win.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 15 methodology analysts | Canonical strategy frameworks as portable, auditable skills |
| Parallel expert teams | Orchestrator-worker architecture; experts run concurrently with explicit task contracts |

## The Skills Library

Fifteen analysts, each a standalone `SKILL.md` encoding a named methodology — its core questions, evidence standards, common failure modes, and output structure:

| Skill | Methodology |
|---|---|
| `five-forces-analyst` | Porter's Five Forces — industry structure and profit pools |
| `value-chain-analyst` | Value chain analysis — where margin actually accrues |
| `jtbd-disruption-analyst` | Jobs-to-be-Done and disruption theory |
| `seven-powers-analyst` | Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers — durable competitive advantage |
| `good-strategy-critic` | Rumelt's kernel — diagnosing bad strategy |
| `playing-to-win-analyst` | Lafley/Martin's strategy cascade |
| `blue-ocean-analyst` | Blue Ocean — value innovation and uncontested space |
| `crossing-the-chasm-analyst` | Moore's technology adoption lifecycle |
| `pestel-analyst` | Macro-environment scanning |
| `tam-sam-som-analyst` | Market sizing with explicit assumptions |
| `ansoff-analyst` | Growth vector analysis |
| `three-horizons-analyst` | McKinsey's three horizons of growth |
| `pyramid-editor` | Minto Pyramid Principle — executive-grade structuring |
| `valuation-analyst` | Comparables and DCF-style sanity checks |
| `mece-engagement-manager` | MECE decomposition and engagement scoping |

Each skill carries a `DISCLAIMER` noting it encodes the published, public form of the methodology — not proprietary content from its authors or their firms.

## Open Source vs. Cloud

Quorum follows an open-core model. Everything in this repository — the skills library, the engagement engine, the quality gates, the source packs — is MIT-licensed and self-hostable, forever. A hosted version with team workspaces, scheduled engagements, and managed data connectors is planned; see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Nothing in the open-source core will be moved behind the cloud offering.

## Honest limitations

We would rather you know these going in:

- **No proprietary content.** Quorum encodes the *published, public* form of each methodology. It does not and will not reproduce paywalled reports, proprietary databases, or expert-network calls.
- **Not a substitute for human judgment.** Reports are decision-support inputs, not decisions. High-stakes calls deserve a human who owns the outcome.
- **Data is only as good as the spine.** Coverage is strongest where official statistics are open and machine-readable. Gaps are flagged, not papered over.
- **Inference is labeled because inference can be wrong.** The `[INFERENCE]` tag exists so you know exactly which claims to pressure-test.

Where Quorum genuinely wins: breadth across public information, geographic coverage no analyst team can match, minutes instead of weeks, two orders of magnitude on cost, and full transparency into how every conclusion was reached.

## Contributing

The two highest-leverage contributions, in order:

1. **A new methodology skill.** Know a framework that deserves a seat at the table? The skill format is plain markdown with a small frontmatter block — no Python required.
2. **A country source pack.** Map the official statistical sources for a country we don't cover yet. One YAML file extends the firm's reach to an entire economy.

Both paths have step-by-step guides in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). We commit to a first response on every PR and issue within 48 hours.
